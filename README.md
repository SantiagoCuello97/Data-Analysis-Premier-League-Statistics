Premier League Statistics (2000-2022)

This is a course project for completion of the course Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas from Jovian & FreeCodeCamp. The main idea is to work with a small dataset (12 columns and 440 rows in this case) to put in practice some of the skills learnt through out the course which include working with functions, methods, variables, datatypes and many more python concepts.

The dataset chosen is from Kaggle and it provides us with all Premier League Statistic from the beggining of the XXI Century up to season 2021-2022. The Premier League is the highest level of the men's English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons typically run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away).

The key points obtained after analyzing the dataset (2000-2022 period) were the following:

1) Who were champions and how many times.
2) Who were relegated and how many times.
3) Which was the champion with the best campaign.
4) Which was the team with the worst campaign.
5) The effectiveness of each team (number of points won over number of points disputed).
6) The campaigns and number of goals scored by the top 5 effective teams.
7) Analysis of some of the most famous English derbies comparing the campaigns of each team.
